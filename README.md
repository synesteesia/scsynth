Ndef synth created in supercollider, inspired by a real monosynth I own.
Has a mixer for different wave shapes, amplitude and envelope control, lfo that is connected to the filter, autofilter effect and chorus effect.
Monophonic and duophonic version in the same file.
Both versions are using a gate to control the sound once a second, but the idea is to use midi later for that and frequency control.
